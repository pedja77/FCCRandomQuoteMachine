For example, you have these\nprimitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot,\nand they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal\nsaying goes: \"N'wam k'honi soit qui mali,\" which means, \"If you think\nyou can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same\ntime, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of\nNorthern Mali that you may be interested in.\"\n So it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic\npublishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest\nnaked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason\nnaked, or whatever.  But if National Geographic were to publish an\narticle entitled \"The Girls of the California Junior College System\nHunt the Wildebeest Naked,\" some people would call it pornography.  But\nothers would not.  And still others, such as the Spectacularly Rev.\nJerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing the wildebeest naked.\n - Dave Barry, \"Pornography\"\n","\nThe cable TV sex channels don't expand our horizons, don't make us better\npeople, and don't come in clearly enough.\n - Bill Maher\n","\nThe capacity of human beings to bore one another seems to be vastly\ngreater than that of any other animals.

This happened about thirty years ago to the son of a Rumanian\ngentleman who was owed a personal favour by Georges Enesco, the celebrated\nviolinist.  Enesco agreed to give lessons to the son who was quite\nunhampered by great musical talent.\n Three years later the boy's father insisted that he give a public\nconcert.  \"His aunt said that nobody plays the violin better than he does.\nA cousin heard him the other day and screamed with enthusiasm.\"  Although\nEnesco feared the consequences, he arranged a recital at the Salle Gaveau\nin Paris.  However, nobody bought a ticket since the soloist was unknown.\n \"Then you must accompany him on the piano,\" said the boy's father,\n\"and it will be a sell out.\"\n Reluctantly, Enesco agreed and it was.  On the night an excited\naudience gathered.  Before the concert began Enesco became nervous and\nasked for someone to turn his pages.\n In the audience was Alfred Cortot, the brilliant pianist, who\nvolunteered and made his way to the stage.\n The soloist was of uniformly low standard and next morning the\nmusic critic of Le Figaro wrote: \"There was a strange concert at the Salle\nGaveau last night.  The man whom we adore when he plays the violin played\nthe piano.  Another whom we adore when he plays the piano turned the pages.\nBut the man who should have turned the pages played the violin.\"\n - Stephen Pile, \"The Book of Heroic Failures\"\n","\nThere are three reasons for becoming a writer: the first is that you need\nthe money; the second that you have something to say that you think the\nworld should know; the third is that you can't think what to do with the\nlong winter evenings.\n - Quentin Crisp\n","\nThere are three rules for writing a novel.

It begins with the vision to\nrecognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over - and to let\ngo.  It means leaving what's over without denying its validity or its\npast importance in our lives.  It involves a sense of future, a belief\nthat every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.\nThe trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It's hard to\nrecognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to\nlearn that we don't leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the\ndugout or the office. We own what we learned back there.  The experiences\nand the growth are grafted onto our lives.

Unlike most garbage\ncollectors, the new gc starts its mark phase from the mind of the user, rather\nthan from the obarray.  This allows the garbage collection of significantly\nmore Qs.  As the garbage collector runs, it may ask you something like \"Do you\nremember what SI:RDTBL-TRANS does?\", and if you can't give a reasonable answer\nin thirty seconds, the symbol becomes a candidate for GCing.

When a\nprogrammer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting\ndown, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  That\nbehavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and\nnever when standing.\n\nMost of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal\nknow whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,\nknow that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to\nhypothesize: was there a loose wire under the carpet, or problems with static\nelectricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.\nAn alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard:\nthe tops of two keys were switched.

Since\nshe was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had\nmoved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to\nhim.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.

At the end of the day he went home (to the\nold address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they\nhad moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of\npaper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There\nwas a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where\nhe had moved to, saying, \"Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I'm Norbert Weiner\nand we've just moved.  Would you know where we've moved to?\"  To which the\nyoung girl replied, \"Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.\"\n The capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the\nstory) about the truth of the story, many years later.

It's great for students, great for somewhat casual\nusers, and it's great for interchanging programs between different machines.\nAnd so, because of its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have\ngood UNIX on VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.\n It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will run\nout of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and will end\nup doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.\n With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and quickly\ncheck that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With VMS, no matter\nwhat you look for - it's literally a five-foot shelf of documentation -- if\nyou look long enough it's there.  That's the difference -- the beauty of UNIX\nis it's simple; and the beauty of VMS is that it's all there.\n -- Ken Olsen, president of DEC, DECWORLD Vol. 8 No. 5, 1984\n[It's been argued that the beauty of UNIX is the same as the beauty of Ken\nOlsen's brain.

The problem\nof frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas\nof computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-\nbian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size\npond - that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that\nthere is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program\nto a frog.  We will suggest these represent a proper subset of frog-computable\nfunctions.\n This is not just a let's-see-how-far-those-frogs-can-jump seminar.\nThis is only for hardcore amphibian-computation people and their colleagues.\n Refreshments will be served.

But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,\nwe have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call\n\"wisdom engineering\".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a\nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.\nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom\nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so\nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic\nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL\nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed\nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those\nunderlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory\nof value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe\nIMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly\ndiscuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.\n","\nStaff meeting in the conference room in ","d minutes.\n","\nStaff meeting in the conference room in 3 minutes.\n","\nStandards are crucial.

SARTRE\nprogrammers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at parties.\n","\n THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: FIFTH\n\nFIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types\nrefer to quantity.  The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and\nJIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and\nBLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,\nCABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.\n\nThe many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and\nfinancial status of its users.  Commands in the ELITE dialect include\nVSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH\nand RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers\nwho end up using this language.\n","\n THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #2: RENE\n\nNamed after the famous French philosopher and mathematician Rene DesCartes,\nRENE is a language used for artificial intelligence.

A spokesman described the language\nas \"Just as great as dis [sic] city of ours.\"\n\nThe center is very pleased with progress to date.

Unfortunately few programmers could survive there because the\ncenter outlawed Pizza and Coca-Cola in favor of Tofu and Perrier.\n\nMany mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a gentle and\nnon-threatening language since all error messages are in lower case.  For\nexample, LAIDBACK responded to syntax errors with the message:\n\n \"i hate to bother you, but i just can't relate to that.  can\n you find the time to try it again?\"\n","\nThe Macintosh is Xerox technology at its best.\n","\n The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the\nmaster programmer to examine.

Some Christians, alas,\nresort to formal lying to obscure such reality.\n- Steve Allen, comedian, from an essay in the book \"The Courage of\n  Conviction\", edited by Philip Berman\n","\n...it still remains true that as a set of cognitive beliefs about the\nexistence of God in any recognizable sense continuous with the great\nsystems of the past, religious doctrines constitute a speculative\nhypothesis of an extremely low order of probability.\n - Sidney Hook\n","\nA fanatic is a person who can't change his mind and won't change the subject.\n - Winston Churchill\n","\nWe're fighting against humanism, we're fighting against liberalism...\nwe are fighting against all the systems of Satan that are destroying\nour nation today...our battle is with Satan himself.\n - Jerry Falwell\n","\nThey [preachers] dread the advance of science as witches do the approach\nof daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subversions\nof the duperies on which they live.\n - Thomas Jefferson\n","\nSaints should always be judged guilty until they are proven innocent.\n - George Orwell\n","\nAs I argued in \"Beloved Son\", a book about my son Brian and the subject\nof religious communes and cults, one result of proper early instruction\nin the methods of rational thought will be to make sudden mindless\nconversions - to anything -- less likely.  Brian now realizes this and\nhas, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with.  The\nproblem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to\na religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy\nis generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and\nirrational -- the powers of reason are surprisingly ineffective in\nchanging the believer's mind.\n- Steve Allen, comedian, from an essay in the book \"The Courage of\n  Conviction\", edited by Philip Berman\n","\nNothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult\nthan to understand him.\n - Fyodor Dostoevski\n","\nWe may not be able to persuade Hindus that Jesus and not Vishnu should\ngovern their spiritual horizon, nor Moslems that Lord Buddha is at the\ncenter of their spiritual universe, nor Hebrews that Mohammed is a major\nprophet, nor Christians that Shinto best expresses their spiritual\nconcerns, to say nothing of the fact that we may not be able to get\nChristians to agree among themselves about their relationship to God.\nBut all will agree on a proposition that they possess profound spiritual\nresources.  If, in addition, we can get them to accept the further\nproposition that whatever form the Deity may have in their own theology,\nthe Deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and\nthey themselves give proof or disproof of the Deity in what they do and\nthink; if this further proposition can be accepted, then we come that\nmuch closer to a truly religious situation on earth.\n - Norman Cousins, from his book \"Human Options\"\n","\nThe Messiah will come.

All proffered\nsamples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to\ncommon tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that\nany such \"show-down\" is sacrilegious and perverse.  The characteristic\nof religion, from their point of view, is that it is intellectually\nsecret, not public; peculiarly revealed, not generally known;\nauthoritatively declared, not communicated and tested in ordinary\nways...It is pertinent to point out that, as long as religion is\nconceived as it is now by the great majority of professed religionists,\nthere is something self-contradictory in speaking of education in\nreligion in the same sense in which we speak of education in topics\nwhere the method of free inquiry has made its way.  The \"religious\"\nwould be the last to be willing that either the history of the\ncontent of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those\nto whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,\nbut is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against\nits being taught in any other spirit.\n- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher,\n  from \"Democracy in the Schools\", 1908\n","\nIn the broad and final sense all institutions are educational in the\nsense that they operate to form the attitudes, dispositions, abilities\nand disabilities that constitute a concrete personality...Whether this\neducative process is carried on in a predominantly democratic or non-\ndemocratic way becomes, therefore, a question of transcendent importance\nnot only for education itself but for its final effect upon all the\ninterests and activities of a society that is committed to the democratic\nway of life.\n - John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher\n","\nHistory shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge,\nperiodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts\nthem asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing\ngrub, at intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another...\nTruly the imago state of Man seems to be terribly distant, but every\nmoult is a step gained.\n - Charles Darwin, from \"Origin of the Species\"\n","\n...I would go so far as to suggest that, were it not for our ego and\nconcern to be different, the African apes would be included in our\nfamily, the Hominidae.\n - Richard Leakey\n","\nIt is inconceivable that a judicious observer from another solar system\nwould see in our species - which has tended to be cruel, destructive,\nwasteful, and irrational -- the crown and apex of cosmic evolution.\nViewing us as the culmination of *anything* is grotesque; viewing us\nas a transitional species makes more sense -- and gives us more hope.\n- Betty McCollister, \"Our Transitional Species\",\n  Free Inquiry magazine, Vol. 8, No. 1\n","\n\"Well, you see, it's such a transitional creature.

This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not\nthat long ago, it was Reagan's support of Creationism....Creationists actually\ngot equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-minded\nto the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were\nscientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the president\nis averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American\nturf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns\ninto a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.

We're dealing with\nbeliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There's nothing there....\nIt sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technical\nterms.  It's got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite\nglib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from\nmetaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The\nfact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that\nshould be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They\nhave not proved their case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there's\nno theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It's been tested\nand tested over the centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at\nall.  It is not even close to a science.

What force or influence,\nwhat sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human\nbeings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding\njargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central\nproblem with astrology - we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which\ncelestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .\nSome astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents\nthe astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those\nof any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always\nclaim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their\nefficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have\ngenerously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed\ntests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .\nI propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest\nin the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them\nkeep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by\nthe firelight, afraid of the night.\n-- Andrew Fraknoi, Executive Officer, Astronomical Society of the Pacific,\n    \"Why Astrology Believers Should Feel Embarrassed,\" San Jose Mercury\n    News, May 8, 1988\n","\nWith the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning\nher husband's schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeles\non the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and\nastrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and\ntechnological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.

Surely we\ndon't (any of us) really believe that there is some big, deep political and\nphilosophical message in all this, do we?  So if this `cyberpunk' thing is\njust a term of convenience, how can somebody sell out?  If cyberpunk is just a\nword we use to describe a particular style and imagery in sf, how can it be\ndead?  Where are the profound statements that the `Movement' is or was trying\nto make?\n I think most of us are interested in examining and discussing literary\n(and musical) works that possess a certain stylistic excellence and perhaps a\nrather extreme perspective; this is what CP is all about, no?  Maybe there\nshould be a newsgroup like, say, alt.postmodern or something.  Something less\nrestrictive in scope than alt.cyberpunk.\n - Jeff G.

Pull one of these\n horses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n of these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n took out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n horses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n are all the same color.

It apparently contributes to a complex\nprocess called aging, of which very little is known, except that it is\nalways fatal.\n\nHowever, the main disadvantage of the 20"," oxygen concentration is in the\nfact it is habit forming.  The first inhalation (occurring at birth) is\nsufficient to make oxygen addiction permanent.  After that, any\nconsiderable decrease in the daily oxygen doses results in death with\nsymptoms resembling those of cyanide poisoning.\n\nOxygen is an extreme fire hazard.

The engineer had constructed a can opener from\npocket trash, used aluminum shavings and dried sugar to make an explosive,\nand escaped.\n The physicist had worked out the angle necessary to knock the lids\noff the tin cans by throwing them against the wall.  She was developing a good\npitching arm and a new quantum theory.\n The mathematician had stacked the unopened cans into a surprising\nsolution to the kissing problem; his dessicated corpse was propped calmly\nagainst a wall, and this was inscribed on the floor:\n Theorem: If I can't open these cans, I'll die.\n Proof: assume the opposite...\n","\nThere was a writer in 'Life' magazine ... who claimed that rabbits have\nno memory, which is one of their defensive mechanisms.

And so it goes that one Indian\ncouple made love on a buffalo  hide.  Nine months later, they were\nblessed with a healthy baby son.  Yet another couple huddled together\non the hide of a deer and they too were blessed with a very healthy\nbaby son.  But a third couple, whose favorite animal was a hippopotamus,\nwere blessed with not one, but TWO very healthy baby sons at the conclusion\nof the nine month interval.
